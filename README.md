# Python_Challenge_1
This challenge was a two part challenge. The first challenge was called PyBank and dealt with budget data. The second part of the challenge dealt with election materials.

PyBank
  In PyBank task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records and calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

PyPoll
  In PyPoll the task was to fictionally help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task was to create a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculate each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
